# SQLDataCleansingProject-HousingDataset : : Import and Cleaning with SQL
Explore SQL data import and cleaning techniques with the Housing Dataset. Import data, standardize formats, and remove duplicates efficiently

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of importing and cleansing data using SQL. The dataset used for this project is the Nashville Housing Dataset, and the goal is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis.

## Dataset
The Nashville Housing Dataset is a collection of housing sales data in Nashville, Tennessee. The dataset includes information such as sale prices, property addresses, sale dates, and more.

## Prerequisites
To run the SQL scripts in this project, you'll need access to a SQL Server database management system (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server). Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create and modify databases and execute SQL queries.

## SQL Scripts
- **import_data.sql**: This script demonstrates how to import the Nashville Housing Dataset into a SQL database using techniques such as BULK INSERT or OPENROWSET.
- **clean_data.sql**: This script outlines the steps involved in cleaning and preparing the imported data. Tasks include standardizing date formats, populating missing values, and removing duplicates.

## Usage
1. Set up a SQL Server environment and create a new database (e.g., NashvilleHousing).
2. Execute the `import_data.sql` script to import the dataset into the database.
3. Run the `clean_data.sql` script to perform data cleansing and preparation tasks.
4. Optionally, customize the scripts or add additional cleaning steps based on your requirements.

## Sample Data
A sample subset of the Nashville Housing Dataset is included in the `sample_data` folder for demonstration purposes. Note that this data is anonymized and should not be used for actual analysis.

## Acknowledgment
This project was created following the tutorial by Alex the analyst on freeCodeCamp.org. I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable insights and guidance provided by Alex throughout the tutorial, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of SQL data import and cleaning techniques.
